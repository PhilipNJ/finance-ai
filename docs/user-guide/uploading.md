## CSV Files

### Format Requirements

CSV files should have financial data in columns. The AI understands various formats:

**Standard Format:**
```csv
Date,Description,Amount
2025-01-15,Whole Foods Market,-45.67
2025-01-16,Coffee Shop,-5.25
2025-01-20,Salary,3500.00
```

**Bank Format:**
```csv
Transaction Date,Posted Date,Merchant Name,Amount,Category
01/15/2025,01/16/2025,WHOLEFDS #123,-45.67,Groceries
```

**Custom Format:**
```csv
When,What,How Much
Jan 15,Whole Foods,$45.67
Jan 16,Starbucks,$5.25
```

!!! tip "Flexible Columns"
    The AI doesn't require specific column names - it understands the *meaning* of the data!

## PDF Files

### What Works

Finance AI can extract transactions from:

- ‚úÖ Bank statements
- ‚úÖ Credit card statements
- ‚úÖ Invoices
- ‚úÖ Receipts
- ‚úÖ Financial reports
- ‚úÖ Even scanned/image PDFs (with OCR)

### PDF Processing Flow

    style C fill:#e8f5e9
    style D fill:#fff9c4
```

### Example: Bank Statement

**Typical Statement:**

```
CHASE BANK
Account: ****1234
Statement Period: 01/01/2025 - 01/31/2025

TRANSACTIONS:
Date       Description              Amount
01/15      WHOLE FOODS MARKET       $45.67
01/16      STARBUCKS #12345          $5.25
01/20      SHELL GAS STATION        $52.00
01/22      AMAZON.COM               $28.99
01/25      PAYROLL DEPOSIT        $3,500.00

SUMMARY:
Beginning Balance: $2,000.00
Total Credits: $3,500.00
Total Debits: -$131.91
Ending Balance: $5,368.09
```

The AI extracts:
- 5 transactions
- Proper categorization
- Date normalization
- Amount parsing (handles $ and commas)

### Scanned PDFs & OCR

If your PDF is a scanned image, Finance AI can still read it!

**Requirements:**

1. Install Tesseract OCR (optional but recommended)

=== "macOS"
    ```bash
    brew install tesseract
    ```

=== "Linux"
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
    ```

=== "Windows"
    Download from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

2. Upload the scanned PDF
3. OCR runs automatically if text extraction fails

!!! warning "OCR Accuracy"
    OCR works best with:
    - High-resolution scans (300+ DPI)
    - Clear, readable text
    - Proper orientation (not rotated)

### PDF Best Practices

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Use original PDFs (not re-scanned)
- Keep file size reasonable (<50MB)
- Ensure text is selectable (if possible)

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Upload password-protected PDFs
- Use extremely low-quality scans
- Rotate documents before uploading (AI can handle rotation)

## Text Files

### Plain Text Input

Simply paste or type financial data:

```
Spent $45.67 at Whole Foods on January 15th
Coffee was $5.25 at Starbucks yesterday  
Got gas for $52.00 last week
Salary deposited: $3,500
```

The AI will:
1. Parse dates (relative like "yesterday" or absolute)
2. Extract amounts (handles $ and various formats)
3. Identify merchants
4. Guess categories

### Structured Text

You can also use basic structure:

```
Transactions for January 2025:

Jan 15 - Whole Foods - $45.67 (groceries)
Jan 16 - Starbucks - $5.25 (coffee)
Jan 20 - Shell - $52.00 (gas)
Jan 22 - Amazon - $28.99 (shopping)
Jan 25 - Salary - $3,500.00 (income)
```

### Mixed Format

Even mixed notes work:

```
Grocery shopping on 1/15: Whole Foods $45.67
Morning coffee @ Starbucks = $5.25 (1/16)
Filled up tank - $52 - January 20th
Amazon purchase: $28.99
Paycheck received 01/25/2025 - $3500
```

The AI understands it all! üß†

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Consistent Date Formats

While the AI handles various formats, consistency helps:

**Good:**
```csv
Date,Description,Amount
2025-01-15,Whole Foods,-45.67
2025-01-16,Starbucks,-5.25
```

**Also Fine:**
```csv
Date,Description,Amount
01/15/2025,Whole Foods,-45.67
01/16/2025,Starbucks,-5.25
```

### 2. Include Currency

If using multiple currencies, include symbols:

```csv
Date,Description,Amount
2025-01-15,Whole Foods,-‚Ç¨45.67
2025-01-16,Starbucks,-¬£5.25
```

### 3. Descriptive Merchants

More context = better categorization:

**Better:**
```
Whole Foods Market #123, Seattle WA
```

**vs:**
```
Purchase
```

### 4. Negative for Expenses

Use negative amounts for spending:

```csv
Amount
-45.67  # Expense
3500.00 # Income
```
